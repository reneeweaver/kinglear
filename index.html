	<p>The production titled Sci-Fi Lear takes Shakespeare's classical text and pushes it into a multi-dimensional formant, with digital projections and puppers of light. Tirabassi looks at the piece through a &quot;Film Eye&quot;, as she directs the actors to move through the digital projections which create a holographic Galactic-Like Effect. Dynamic movement, visuals and sound express the poetry of the play for a better understanding of the emotions behind Shakespeare's sometimes complicated text. This exploration of of a 400 year old masterpiece (with 200 years of controversy) has brought about a documentary called Sci-Finding Lear as a result of a &quot;New-Tradition&quot; type process of finding a more human King Lear play and a more truthful interpretation of the writing due to less bounderies of exploration.</p>
	<p>Tirabassi remarks excitedly, &quot;I have been living and working in my art gallery in Pilsen for many years and the timing was perfect for Igloo.&quot;</p>
